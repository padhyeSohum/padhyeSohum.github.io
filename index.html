      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Some Languages I Know</h1>
      <p>
        No, not speaking languages. Coding languages. There are over 700 coding languages, and I only know a few: Python, JavaScript, HTML (This is currently 
        how I am making my website), CSS, and C#. This may seem like a lot, but I'll have you know that I am in no way fluent with any of these; I still have a 
        lot to learn. When I first started, I was learning python. I was also learning about concepts in coding, like functions, arrays, objects, loops, and 
        more. I have an instructor and he teaches me everything I know. I also take some courses from Udemy, Udacity, and other websites that are great for 
        learning. Anyways, after a couple months of learning Python, my instructor decided to start teaching me HTML. When I first encountered HTML code, I
        learned that it was very different from Python. "Why are these 'less than' and 'greater than' signs everywhere?", "Why does every document I open start
        off with code?", and many more questions started popping in my head. HTML was a very foreign language to my limited knowledge with Python. However, once
        my instructor and I went over everything, it started to become much easier. Later, I started building Flask programs. Flask is a tool used to connect 
        HTML to Python. I was able to transfer data from Python to HTML files and that made everything much easier. I then connected Python to databases, which 
        allowed me to store data in tables. I used MySQL for this. Moving on, I started learning more on the side of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to 
        use CSS to make my pages look good, and not like a Word document. I started using JavaScript with DOM elements to interact with my HTML. I learned much 
        more about JavaScript and Node JS with some free courses on YouTube. Outside of my coding classes, I also took a C# Unity course. This tought me how to 
        use C# with Unity, which is basically a game engine.

      <p>
        As of December 2020, I'm working on making a chatbot. I'm not using NLP, which is a branch of Machine Learning, but I am using RegEx (Regular Expressions).
        With RegEx, I am able to search for certain words in inputs. When the searches have a match, I can give an answer corresponding to the question. However, 
        RegEx is very limiting compared to NLP, and you can use Machine Learning to create an NLP model. I am currently taking a course on Machine Learning on 
        Udemy, and it is teaching me a lot; not only how to implement Machine Learning code, but also knowing the intuition behind it. If interested, the course 
        is called "Machine Learning A-Z." The course roles are split up into two people: Hadelin Ponteves, the one who helps implement the code to make the Machine 
        Learning model, and Kirill Eremenko, the one who explains the intuition behind the code. I think that they are both very good at explaining what is 
        happening, and though I can't understand the math (that's not on them),  it is still a great experience to learn about all these different things.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently trying to use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), which are used for identifying objects in images and videos, on Autonomous Vehicles.
        I'm very passionate in the field of Autonomous Vehicles and I want to create one that will save lives of millions, and even billions. I still have a lot
        to learn in this field, though. There are two major competitors in this field: Tesla and Waymo. Tesla is relying on cameras to pick up objects and people,
        but Waymo is focusing on using LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) to map out a 3D view of the environment. The major downside to this is that LiDAR 
        cameras are very expensive, meanwhile the cameras Tesla is using are not. In terms of the race, it may seem like Waymo is leading, because they don't 
        have any deaths so far and Tesla has around 10. However, Waymo's cars have only been tested in Arizona, USA, and Tesla's cars are being tested around the
        globe. Over 3700 people die of car crashes every day. I am working to stop this. I am trying to find a way where Autonomous Vehicles can connect and 
        understand where others are so that they can all make safer and faster decisions. Since they will all be connected, it will save time for a lot of people
        and break the <a href="https://youtu.be/iHzzSao6ypE">Phantom Intersection</a>.
